# QEditor

An editor for QuestJS

This is in a fairly early stage of development, so do not expect too much yet! It should be useable on Unix and MacOS, though I have only tried on Windows as that is all I have.

It is written in Python using Django, and is run as a web server. Once it is up and running, access it via your browser. Help files are included, and accessed from within it.
