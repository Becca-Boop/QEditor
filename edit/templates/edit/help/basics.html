    <h3>Using The QuestJS Editor</h3>
    <p>The editor is actually a web server, and you interact with it via a browser like any other web site. All the data is saved in a database.</p>
    <p>An important issue to be aware of here is <i>when</i> data is saved to the database and <i>when</i> pages are updated. Data is saved to the database only when you click a button on the web page (and not when you click a link!).</p>
    <p>On the home page, there will be a list of locations and items. These are links, so clicking one does not change the database, but will open up that object in a browser tab. You will see a number of button across the top; "Home", "Naming", etc. Clicking these will take you to different sections for that object. And as these are buttons, when you do click them, the database will be updated.</p>
    <p>You can have as many objects open in the editor as you like, each in its own tab. However, when you want to close a tab, you should do so via the "Close" button, as that will ensure the data is saved. If you close the tab by clicking the cross at the top, you will loose any changes since you last clicked a button for that object. The same applies if you reload the page.</p>
    <p>All links on these pages should open a new tab to ensure you do not lose data. If you find any that do not, let me know! That is a bug.</p>
