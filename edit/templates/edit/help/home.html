    <h3>Welcome to the QuestJS Editor Help!</h3>
    <p><i>If you can see something about "extends" and "base.html" at the top of this page, you are viewing the raw page. You are better viewing the page via the editor's web server. If you need help on setting that up, see <a href="{% url 'edit:help' 'web_server' %}">here</a><i></p>
    
    <p>The QuestJS Editor lets you create interactive fiction, using the QuestJS game engine. It is designed to allow you to create games with as much flexibility as possible, but a the same time is capable of handling games of great size and complexity. It is still in a very early form, and there is much yet to do, but it is in a state where you can see how it works, and you can add locations and items. As yet, exits are not supported.</p>
