    <h3>Exit</h3>
    <p>Exits have lots of options, but most of the time there is only one you need to consider.</p>
    
    <p>The origin, where the exit goes from, and the direction are set up when you create the exit and cannot be changed.</p>
    <p>The desttination is the location the player will be taken to. For most erxists that is all you need to worry about.</p>
